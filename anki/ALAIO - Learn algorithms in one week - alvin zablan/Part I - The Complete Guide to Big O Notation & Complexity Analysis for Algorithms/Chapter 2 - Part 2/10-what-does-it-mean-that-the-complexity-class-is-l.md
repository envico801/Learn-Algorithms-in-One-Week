Q: What does it mean that the complexity class is Loglinear - 0(n\*log(n))?  
A: O(n log n) implies that log n operations will occur n times.  
1.Has linear behavior nested in log steps  
2.Is bigger than O(n) but smaller than O(n^2)  
e.g. O(n log n) time is common in recursive sorting algorithms, binary tree sorting algorithms and most other types of sorts.
