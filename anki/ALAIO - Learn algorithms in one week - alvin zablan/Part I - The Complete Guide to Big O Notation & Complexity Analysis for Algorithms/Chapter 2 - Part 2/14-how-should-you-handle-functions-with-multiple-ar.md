Q: How should you handle functions with multiple arguments?  
A: You should separate the arguments/variables with different letters to identify them and specify what they represent.  
For example:  
1.O(n) = O (m+n), Where m, n are the array lenghts  
2.0(max(m, n) ), where m, n are the string lengths  
3.0(n), where n is the length of the longer string
