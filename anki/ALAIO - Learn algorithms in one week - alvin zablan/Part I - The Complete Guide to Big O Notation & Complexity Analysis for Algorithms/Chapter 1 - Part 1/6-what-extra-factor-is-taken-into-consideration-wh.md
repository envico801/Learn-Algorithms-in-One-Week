Q: What extra factor is taken into consideration when we want to calculate the space complexity of the recursive code?  
A: Our space complexity should consider the space taken by recursive calls on the call stack.  
When you analyze the space complexity of a recursive code, what you really have to think about is how many stack frames or how many recursive calls I have to make before I get to the base case.
