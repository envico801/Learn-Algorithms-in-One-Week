Q: What does it mean that the complexity class is Factorial - O(n!)?  
A: The time complexity of calculating n! is proportional to the size of the input, which is n. Each number from 1 to n needs to be multiplied together, resulting in a time complexity that grows rapidly with increasing values of n.  
1.n! = (n) (n-1) (n-2) (n-3)...(2) (1)  
2.4! = 4 \* 3 \* 2 \* 1 = 24
