Q: How should you handle functions with multiple arguments?  
A: You should separate the arguments/variables with different letters to identify them and specify what they represent.  
For example:
1. O(n) = O (m+n), Where m, n are the array lengths
2. 0(max(m, n) ), where m, n are the string lengths
3. 0(n), where n is the length of the longer string
