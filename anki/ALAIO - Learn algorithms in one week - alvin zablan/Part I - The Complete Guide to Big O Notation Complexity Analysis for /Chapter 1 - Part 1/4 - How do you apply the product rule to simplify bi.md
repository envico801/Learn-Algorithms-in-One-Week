Q: How do you apply the product rule to simplify Big O?  
A: The rule says that **if Big 0 is the product of multiple terms, constant terms are eliminated (constant terms are like static numbers, numbers like 1, 4, 5, basically anything that is not a variable)**.  
After this, the sum rule should be applied.
